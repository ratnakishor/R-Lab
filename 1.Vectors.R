# Aim: To demonstrate vector operations in R.


# Vectors - Definition and Features.


# 1.Creation of vectors using a.c() function, b. colon operator and c. seq() function.


# 2.Use of indexing to access the individual elements in vectors.


# 3.Use of negative index to remove elements from vectors.


# 4.Use of slicing to select a part of vector.


# 5.Filtering the elements of a vector using a. vector of logical values and b. condition.


# 6.Create an empty vector and insert some elements in to it. 


# Conclusion:
